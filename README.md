# Portfolio CMS Pages:
Using the content management files worked on in class, create content management forms and files for the project content in your portfolio:
Forms and links to add, edit and delete project content from the projects table and all associated tables containing project references. Use the same file-linking structure shown in class, and apply some CSS styling to align and organize the pages/forms.
This includes project image content, which should be uploaded as well as the match- ing name inserted into the database. The ‘add project’ form and script needs to allow for text and image uploading in a single form.
Use the Login structure built in class for your CMS files.
